REVELATION:
no other book in the Bible so carefully and fully explains its supernatural origin, its chain of transmission, and the exact way the message was communicated to the writer. it also stresses that john was commanded to write about only the things to which he was a personal eyewitness. the essential point is this: John constantly testifies throughout the Book that he "saw" and "heard" the things about which he writes.
