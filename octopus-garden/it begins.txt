Here it is. The day has come. 
i must begin writing my novel 
how's that novel coming along brian? got a big stack of papers there?
nice little story you got going? yeah?
you were talking about that three years ago
been working on that the whole time?
got a nice little narrative? beginning, middle and end?
got a compelling protagonist? and he has to overcome an obstacle of some kind?

yeah all that is true. this is the first day of nanowrimo. i've been super excited and DREADING THE F*** out of this day for nearly a month.
but i figured all that fear would go away on the actual day of. i figured i'd hop out of bed this morning and get cracking. work all day. finish a whole week's worth of writing. well, maybe not that much. but i certainly didn't expect to put this off until almost ten pm. that's right. it's almost ten PM and i still have all 1666 words to write.
i must just be really terrified of writing a bad story. the first draft is always shit. just remember the words of ernest hemingway and let it be shit.
