\f0\fs30 \cf0 Maybe the team has no personal vendetta with cancer until after the $mana is already created, goverment-seized, and squashed. Other than $jack's mom. But we make a point that back when that happened he responded emotionally, thus the actions he took were emotional. going on breast cancer walks, making tribute videos. he thought of cancer as a sentient, evil being who murdered his mother in cold blood. playing $spaceInvaders changed that. $jack and $jess played it high and it clicked in their brains (maybe simultaneously to establish their cosmic connection) that cancer is just one of the many glitches in the human software. Either that or it's some kind of malware written by our alien creators to attack us at random as a means of population control. Either way, like many software glitches throughout our history, humans have only to patch it out of existence. It's an enormous challenge of course, but in comparing it to the artificial intelligence in a video game, a cure seemed plausible for the first time.\
