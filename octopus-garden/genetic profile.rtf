\f0\fs30 \cf0 science: the drug imatinib (Gleevec) was designed to inhibit an altered enzyme produced by a fused version of two genes found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. another example is the breast cancer drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), which works only for women whose tumors have a particular genetic profile called HER-2 positive. Studies have also found lung cancer petients whose tumors are positive for EGFR mutations respond to the drugs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) which target this mutation. On the other hand, colon cancer patients whose tumors have a mutation in a gene called KRAS derive little benefit from the drugs cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix). The type of genomic information generated by the cancer genome atlas and other cancer genomics projects will drive research to develop similar treatment strategies that will be most effective for a given set of genomic changes. \
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of an individual takes about 26 hours. rapid WGS is imperative in light of growing evidence of its utility in acute care, such as in diagnosis of genetic diseases in very ill infants, and genotype-guided choice of chemotherapy at cancer relapse. in such situations, delayed, empiric, or phenotype-based* clinical decisions may meet with substantial morbidity or mortality. we previously described a rapid WGS method, STATseq, with a sensitivity of >96% for nucleotide variants that allowed a provisional diagnosis of a genetic disease in 50 hrs. here, improvements in sequencing runtime, read alignment, and variant calling are described that enable 26-hr. time to provisional molecular diagnosis with >99.5% sensitivity and specificity of genotypes. STATseq appears to be an appropriate strategy for acutely ill patients with potentially actionable genetic diseases.\

*phenotype = an individual's observable traits, such as height, eye color, and blood type. the genetic contribution to the phenotype is called the genotype, while other traits are largely determined by environmental factors.}
