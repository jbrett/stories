Sarah Gregory:
though i am reading these alphabetically, i should mention that yours was the first entry i wrote. i don't know if that means you're the most important because you were at the forefront of my mind in that moment, or the least important because i elected to use your entry as a "practice run", but i don't think it's the latter.
Though I know words of affirmation don't mean a lot to you, I just want to say that you are fucking awesome. your generous endowment of brains, beauty and wit notwithstanding, i've never met someone who was so unabashedly herself. ever since that time you marched into the beatgasm room and announced that you were in need of anything chocolate or chocolate-flavored we could produce from our desks, i began keeping a spare supply of chocolate in my desk. it's true. i did so for a couple of reasons: first, i celebrate your shameless individualism that allows you to not only proclaim to a room full of people that your immediate plan involves the release of some $pheremones in your brain by devouring any mass of available chocolate, but that you would make us even more deeply aware of it by requesting our assistance in that release and second, because whatever it is that you need to keep those juices flowing, especially whatever juices fertilized the brilliance of your marketing personas, i do not want to be the thing that stands in your way. the levels of knowledge, wisdom and courage you've attained at your young age make me want to follow your strategy career closely just to marvel at the extent of what you'll undoubtedly accomplish in your lifetime.

$pheremones = not sure what chocolate actually releases in brain, or wherever. gotta figure that out.
