Sarah Gregory:
though i am reading these alphabetically, i should mention that yours was the first entry i wrote. i don't know if that means you're the most important because you were at the forefront of my mind in that moment, or the least important because i elected to use your entry as a "practice run", but i don't think it's the latter.
Though I know words of affirmation don't mean a lot to you, I just want to say that you are fucking awesome. your generous endowment of brains, beauty and wit notwithstanding, i've never met someone who was so unabashedly herself. ever since that time you marched into the beatgasm room and announced that you were in need of anything chocolate or chocolate-flavored we could produce from our desks, i began keeping a spare supply of choclate in my desk. it's true. ask anyone who sits around me. the levels of knowledge, wisdom and discernment you've attained at your young age make me want to follow your strategy career closely just to marvel at the extent of what you'll undoubtedly accomplish in your lifetime.
