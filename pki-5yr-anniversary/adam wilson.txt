adam, i can't imagine what you must go through every day to shield me from the wrath of certain clients. and you know that because you're the h-d project manager, my daily interaction with you is likely to be my least favorite interaction of the day. and still somehow, i like you. that speaks volumes about either your personality or your ability to manipulate developer types.
