there were times in my life when being jack brett was not something to be proud of. my little eccentricities like $eccentritities were not always celebrated. i usually had a few birds of a feather to flock with, but the consensus of my peers as a whole was that i was just kind of a weirdo. after finding my way through the doors of 10 W Hubbard, everything changed. some days i feel like the prettiest girl at the dance, WHICH btw is a perfect example of a statement that would've gotten be beaten right up in middle school.
never have i been around such a group of people. so perfectly flawed, and so unabashedly themselves.




$eccentritities = some endearing/annoying/strange quirks of mine that pki loves but hope christian school would've hated
