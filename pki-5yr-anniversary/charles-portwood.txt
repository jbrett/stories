Charles Portwood:
you and i are very different people. no doubt about it. but i think there are a couple of reasons we get along so well: 1) you've thoroughly evaluated my cognitive, social, and motor skills and ultimately determined that i am not a threat, 2) we both feel a bit more validated by any praise of our work, written or verbal, by someone who understands what we did.
i used to think you were a genius. but i don't think that anymore, because that term implies a natural gift that might allow someone to understand and accomplish things more easily than others. you've worked hard your entire life to be where you are. even now you arrive early in the morning to prepare defenses for the assault the dev team will launch on your servers that day. most days you win that fight, and go home in victory at a decent hour. but the nights where some developer unknowingly kicks off a script that re-indexes the entire internet and then turns off his phone and goes home, you dive in 
possibly the greatest testament to your precision and mastery of your craft is the fact that when i tell you $thingThatIDid and you casually rotate your head five degrees and affix your eyes to your second monitor for 419 milliseconds then declare "No, you didn't", I would believe you. You heard that right: I would question my own memory before questioning your mastery of this craft.

$thingThatIDid = something i incidentally altered on the server causing sometihng to break
